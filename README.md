# CS-250-Software-Development-LifeCycle

The project was a program made to track items for a grocery. The company needed a program that records the items that were purchased in a chronological format to help reorganize their stores. Having the program read the file as well as write the info to another file was easy, as I had just learned and got the hang of how it works before this project. Where I started to stumble was finding how to properly print the ways of displaying the data to fit the company's needs. I think more precise comments and cleaner method names will help me in the future. After all, I did forget to update or add comments that properly explain the things I did, so it was a bit hard to explain. But, it was less about the coding aspect and more about bringing the company's vision to life, once I fully understood the task it was just writing for and while loops. The aspect of reading and writing files will definitely be of use in future work in my IT career path, as I think I can adapt the code to work with any text file.
